Tired of seeing your bronze icon because you obviously belong in GM? This application gives you a moveable rank icon to place over your profile. Now you can be GM forever!

Also includes support for all ranks, incase you feel like playing as a bronze in your masters game. Support for T500 icon will be added in the near future.

To use the application, start the jar found in the release section of this page. You'll see a icon appear in your taskbar's toolset (Windows users only) that allows you to configure the icon with a right click.
